I am a huge movie buff, so when I am not coding I generally have some visual entertainment going in the background.  A few favorites include The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and Ready Player One. In addition, I am a pretty big Star Wars nerd. I also enjoy television shows like The Big Bang Theory and Supernatural.
