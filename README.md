<h1>Scott Lyman</h1>

<p>I am recent graduate of the Immersive Full Stack program at CodeWorks, an intensive 13-week programming bootcamp located in Boise, Idaho. I spent the last 3 months building my skills and knowledge in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript ES6 utilizing varying frameworks by bulding out several varied applications from the ground up.  I have also gained experience with NodeJS, Vue and Vue-Router, Auth0 and MongoDB as well as C# with MySQL database during these builds.</p>

<h3>About me</h3>
<p>I am a huge movie buff, so when I am not coding I generally have some visual entertainment going in the background.  A few favorites include The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and Ready Player One (the novel was WAY better, and it has a sequel!). In addition, I am a pretty big Star Wars nerd. I also enjoy television shows like The Big Bang Theory and Supernatural.</p>

<p>My previous careers have been in customer service and logistics.  Most recently, I was a branch Operations Manager for a company specializing in final mile delivery of carpet and hard surface flooring.  It was here that I developed a majority of my team leadership and management skills.  Prior to that I worked as a server and bartender, gaining experience in client-facing industries while developing interpersonal communication, problem-solving and team-oriented skills.</p>

<p>I am very excited to have successfully completed the Full Stack program at CodeWorks and now be jumping into the future of software development!  I am humbled and grateful to call myself part of the dev community and excited to continue along my path as a developer</p>
