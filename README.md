I am a huge movie buff, so when I am not coding I generally have some visual entertainment going in the background.  A few favorites include The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and Ready Player One. In addition, I am a pretty big Star Wars nerd. I also enjoy television shows like The Big Bang Theory and Supernatural.

My previous careers have been in customer service and logistics.  Most recently, I was a branch Operations Manager for a company specializing in final mile delivery of carpet and hard surface flooring.  It was here that I developed team leadership and management skills.  Prior to that I worked as a server and bartender, gaining experience in client-facing industries while developing interpersonal communication, problem-solving and team-oriented skills.  

I am very excited about completing my program at CodeWorks and jumping into the future of software development!  Getting to be a part of this skyrocketing industry with amazing potential is a fantastic feeling!
